This repo is a collection of clients deobfuscated using my additions to `openrs2 deob`. Hopefully it saves someone time.

## Inspect a specific revision

Fresh clones: `git clone https://github.com/RuneWiki/openrs2-nonfree -b 555`

Already cloned: `git checkout 555` OR `git fetch origin 555 && git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD` depending on your needs.

The latter may come in handy as this repo force-writes over revision branches when there have been deob process improvements.

If you've cloned and you're reading this file currently... change your branch!
